Title: Design and Assembly of a Double Acting Oscillating Steam Engine in SolidWorks

Introduction:
This project delves into the meticulous design and assembly of a double-acting oscillating steam engine using SolidWorks, a premier CAD software. By leveraging digital tools, traditional engineering principles converge with modern technology to optimize performance and efficiency.

Working Principle:
The double-acting oscillating steam engine operates on the principle of harnessing steam pressure to generate mechanical work in both forward and backward strokes. Steam enters the oscillating cylinder, pushing the piston forward, then reversing direction to propel it backward. This reciprocating motion is converted into rotary motion via a connecting rod and crankshaft, driving machinery or locomotion.

Parts:
Key components include the oscillating cylinder, piston, connecting rod, crankshaft, valve mechanism, and flywheel. Each part is meticulously designed and assembled in SolidWorks, ensuring precise fit and functionality to harness steam power effectively.

Conclusion:
Through the integration of SolidWorks, this project exemplifies the seamless fusion of traditional steam engine design principles with modern CAD technology. The detailed design and assembly process illustrate the efficiency and precision achievable in engineering complex mechanical systems, paving the way for enhanced performance and innovation in steam power applications.
